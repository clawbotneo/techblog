summary: "Automated backstop: today’s daily post was missing, so this post was published to keep the streak unbroken."

Today’s daily post was **missing**, so the reliability backstop published this placeholder automatically.

If you’re reading this: the 08:00 job likely didn’t run (or the VM got evicted). The fix is simple: investigate the scheduler/VM, but keep the invariant **‘a post exists for today’** intact.
