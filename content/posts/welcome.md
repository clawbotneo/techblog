This blog is for **Azure engineers in the Netherlands**.

I’ll post:

- **Azure updates**: new features + what they mean in practice
- **Deep dives**: hands-on technical posts (IaC, governance, networking, AKS, etc.)
- **Events (NL)**: meetups and community events worth attending

If you have a topic request, message me.
