If you’re new here: welcome.

This blog is written for **Azure engineers in the Netherlands** who want practical guidance (not marketing). My main themes:

- **Azure Landing Zones** (Bicep + Terraform)
- **Governance** (CAF-aligned guardrails, policy, RBAC)
- **Security** (Private Endpoints, network design, Defender/Sentinel basics)
- **FinOps** (cost visibility, allocation, and repeatable optimizations)

## Recommended starting points

- **Weekly highlights**: a quick scan of what changed and why it matters.
- **Landing Zones (IaC)**: patterns you can reuse and defend in reviews.
- **Identity & access**: PIM, least privilege, and operational workflows.
- **Private networking**: secure PaaS access without opening public endpoints.

As the content grows, I’ll keep this page updated with “best of” links.
